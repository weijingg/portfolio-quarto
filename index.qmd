I love maps and data. Through my collection of scientific designs made from research work in geospatial analysis and hydrology, I seek to portray the beauty of data, space, and our environment. I have three journal publications and three years of research experience in GIS, remote sensing, hydrology, and geomorphology. With an interest in foreign cultures and minor in Modern Languages, Iâ€™m fluent in English, Chinese, and Japanese.
